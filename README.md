# DroppedNews
Drupal-powered iOS News App - Swift 3.0

Version 0.5

DroppedNews is a template for building Drupal-powered iOS news apps (like the Washington Post News app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-washington-post/id938922398?mt=8)

This version uses static data.  Version 1.0 -- coming soon -- will be powered by an API generated by a Drupal 8 website.  

Suggestions, feature-requests and PRs welcome
